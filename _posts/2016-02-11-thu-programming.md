Today, we learned how to use the ```draw()``` function to create [animations].

We completed the following lessons on [Kahn Academy]:

- [Animation Basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/animation-basics/a/what-are-animations)
- [Interactive Programs](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/interactive-programs/p/mouse-interaction)

We also had a closer look at [Processing.js] - the Javascript technology used in the [Kahn Academy] on-line Javascript
tutorials.

- [downloaded] and [installed] Processing.js
