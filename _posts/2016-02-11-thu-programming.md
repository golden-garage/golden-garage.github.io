Today, we learned how to use the ```draw()``` function to create [animations].

We completed the following lessons on [Kahn Academy]:

- [Animation Basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/animation-basics/a/what-are-animations)
- [Interactive Programs](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/interactive-programs/p/mouse-interaction)

We also had a closer look at [Processing.js] - the Javascript technology used in the [Kahn Academy] on-line Javascript
tutorials.

- [downloaded] and [installed] Processing.js

**[ClockShield]** created some [circle mania using Processing](/assets/2016-02-11-clockshield-circle-mania.pde).

**Hint:** move your mouse over the canvas on the right.

<table>
<tr>
<td markdown="1" style="vertical-align: top;">
~~~ processing
{% include 2016-02-11-clockshield-circle-mania.pde %}
~~~
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<canvas data-processing-sources="/assets/2016-02-11-clockshield-circle-mania.pde"></canvas>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**[ClockShield]** also created [a Shooting Star using Processing](/assets/2016-11-02-clockshield-shooting-star.pde).

<table>
<tr>
<td markdown="1" style="vertical-align: top;">
~~~ processing
{% include 2016-02-11-clockshield-shooting-star.pde %}

</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<canvas data-processing-sources="/assets/2016-02-11-clockshield-shooting-star.pde"></canvas>
