<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->

I'm consolidating the various projects that I have been working on into one place: this garage.

This garage is a lot like other garages. However, instead of a car being parked in this garage, there are boxes full of
miscelleanous stuff stacked in the corners, projects half-finished (half-started) spread across a couple of old tables,
and there against one wall under a tarp, is some music gear - amps, mic stands, keyboards, guitars - they just need to
be plugged in, and the music will flow.

It's a been a while since I've really hung out in the garage. But, that is changing.

Some of the boxes stacked in the corners haven't been opened in years. Some boxes are overstuffed and you can see
things poking out - trying to escape. Other, neglected boxes, are starting to fall apart. Some boxes are a mystery -
I'm not sure if they belong in this garage at all.

The projects still taking up space on the tables in the garage need to be worked on and finished, or they need to be
moved off of the tables to make room for something new. A few of the projects are clearly broken or missing parts. One
or two projects look close to completion. I wonder if the pile of parts on the small table is a project in process or
something I've forgotten to put away?

These melodies and chords in my head need to be expressed - some *gently, soulfully* - others with the volume knob
turned up to *e l e v e n !* The guitars need to be tuned. My fingers are soft - missing their calluses. The mics need
to be plugged in. My voice is older - but, still wants to sing. I wonder what else is under that tarp?

It's time to clean-up, reorganize and play.
