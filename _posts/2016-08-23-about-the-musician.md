## lost in the valley

While sitting in a cave near the [Manzanita Mine], over looking Sulfur Creek near [Wilbur Hot Springs], I wrote my
first song, "the Sun, the Wind, the Moon and the Rain". I was twenty-five. 

My oldest child at the time was seven and my youngest five. The song reflected upon loss and the pain of
divorce. Singing the song was an excellent release to the pressures I felt at the time.

For the next five years, as I drifted through many unplanned adventures and strange trips, a guitar was my constant
companion. 

I taught myself to play the guitar, so I didn't learn to play it well. But it did support me as I sang my way soulfully
through those turbulent times.

I didn't really learn to sing, either. But, I did find a way through my voice to let go and heal.

## finding a friend on the road

My resignation to travel for work, created the opportunity for me to travel to [Erlangen, Germany] and to work for
[Spirit Link, GmbH]. Through that job, I did manage to find a spirit link to a new best friend, [Ingo].

In the basement of his house, Ingo had a guest bedroom - that he had converted into a music studio - and I was welcome
to stay there whenever I worked in Erlangen.

I lived in that music studio five days a week for a very long, peaceful time. 

During the day, Ingo and I worked together. We were teammates at Spirit Link. 

In the evening, we'd make music until we could no longer keep our eyes open. 

Ingo played keyboards and drums. I played guitar and sang. 

He mixed all our creativity together and produced some amazing songs. [Indigo Blues].

## returning home

It's been more than ten years since I was in Erlangen. 

I stopped traveling to Erlangen as Ingo fell in love with Fiddi, as I finally managed to find a job that required a lot
less travel.

I could finally work on rebuilding my relationships at home in Gueltlingrn, Germany. Music was set aside again. 

I did play the guitar occasionally and sing, but I had stopped making music.

## returning home again

It's been more than 7 years since I've lived in Germany - since I've returned to the United States.

My kids are now either married and focused on their families, or off to college focused on gaining their independence.

Now, once again, I have time for music.
