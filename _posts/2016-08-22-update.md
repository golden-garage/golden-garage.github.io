It's been almost a year and I've finally updated the site. Good for me.

## reorganized

I've done a bit of reorganizing in the garage. But, I have not (yet) unpacked many boxes.

There are now [classes](/classes), [music](/music) and [rpilab](/rpilab) sections.


### [classes](/classes)

It's not (yet) up to date, however this is where I'll be putting my teaching materials and a (cobweb covered) class
blog.


### [music](/music)

I do create music from time to time. This section will have links to anything I uncover.


### [rpilab](/rpilab)

This is a project to create a production quality devops environment using Raspberry Pis.

The project is focused more on experimenation than high-availability. So, the cluster is not really "production"
quality. But, it has all the right concepts in place.
