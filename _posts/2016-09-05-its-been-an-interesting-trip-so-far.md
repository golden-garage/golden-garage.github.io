The changes in my life continually encourage me to transform my point of view.


## the immigrant

I lived on the East Coast for 15 yeers, and on the West Coast for 15 years. I also lived in Europe for 17 years. I
moved back to the USA 7 years ago.

Moving from the East Coast (upstate New York between Erie and Niagra Falls) to the West Coast (Marin Country, Ca) was
nearly as transformative to me at 15 as my move to Germany was when I was 30, or my move back to the USA was when I was
47.

Each of these moves brought with them a new set of influences, challenges and opportunties. Each of these moves
required me to adapt to new priorities and perspectives. Each of these moves asked me to change my point of view and
transform my self.


## the worker

I've worked as a computer programmer, a receptionist, a children's shoe salesman, a cook on a tugboat, a street
musician, a tub scrubber, a bath builder, a roofer, an astrologer, a tarot card reader, a software architect, a
technology evangelist, a product manager, a vice-president and also as a chief operating officer.

Each of these jobs brought with them a new set of influences, challenges and opportunties. Each of these jobs required
me to adapt to new priorities and perspectives. Each of these jobs asked me to change my point of view and transform
my self.


## the family man

I have been married twice and I have five kids.

Each of these families brought with them a new set of influences, challenges and opportunties. Each of these families
required me to adapt to new priorities and perspectives. Each of these families asked me to change my point of view and
transform my self.


## the middle of five generations

I am simultaneously a son, a grandson, a father and a grandfather. There are five generations currently living in my
family. I am the oldest child of the middle generation.

My role in each of these generations brings with it a set of influences, challenges and opportunties. Each of these
generations requires me to adapt to its priorities and perspectives. Each of these gernations asks me to change my
point of view and transform my self.


## multiple points of view

I have shared a lot of love and kindess with many different people - in many different places - in many different
professions - in different familes - from different generations - each with their own point of view.

I have also experienced the opposite of love and kindness, from those trapped in their own points of view.

As I shared experiences with others, I learned to understand the other persons point of view - even why I was treated
with the opposite of love and kindness.


## setst

But, in those shared experiences, I also learned that 

- I cannot change another persons point of view - I can only change mine, and
- Each person is responsible for their own point of view.


## getting along

I _do not_ wonder why we all just don't get along. I can understand why we don't get along.

So long as people continue to choose to trap themselves in their own beliefs            <br>
- rather than opening their own perspectives to other points of view;                   <br>
so long as people continue to shun other points of view as invalid or inferior          <br>
- rather than accept the opportunity to learn from the differences;                     <br>
so long as people use their own point of view to distinguish themselves from others ... <br>
people will continue to fight over who is right and who is wrong.

It is up to each of us to embrace the opportunities that transform our own points of view.
