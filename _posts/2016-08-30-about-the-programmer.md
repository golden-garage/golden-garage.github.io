In the summer of 1972, I sat in the computer lab at [SUNY Fredonia] and completed my first [CAI tutorial] for
programming in the computer programming language [APL]. I was nine years old.


## ancient history

Today, I teach nine year olds how to program during week long summer camps and after school workshops. 

However, back in 1972 when I was nine - back when computers were programmed with [punched cards], data was stored on
[9-track tape] and [program] output was delivered the next day (at the earliest) on green and white barred
[print-out paper] - back when a single computer weighed thousands of pounds, required multiple cabinets, an entire air
conditioned room of its own with a team of human operators to keep its [jobs] running - back when [COBOL] was king of
the [mainframes] and [Pascal] was the pawn of [microcomputers] - back in 1972, there weren't very many 9 year olds
programming computers.


## programming language collection

Most of the programming that I have done since then, has been in [structured programming] languages like [PL/I],
[FORTRAN], [BASIC], [Pascal], [UCSD Pascal], [C], [C++], [C#], [Objective C] and [Java].

I did occasionally write code in languages like [APL], [FORTH], [LISP], and [Scheme]; however, I could not find an
employer that would actually invest beyond prototypoing solutions using these non-structured languages.

I have however had some success in recent years introducing organizations to scripting languages like [Python] and
[Javascript].


## technology evangelist

I have also had the privilege of working in many different domains applying leading technologies through each cutting
edge wave of programming techniques, architectural frameworks and design patterns. 

I have championed [distributed computing], [scripting languages], [SOA], [web applications], [CMS], [ESBs],
[web services], [nosql], [map-reduce], [containerization], [micro-services] and [cluster computing];
[top down structured approach], [UML], [use cases], [XP - extreme programming], [iterative development],
[agile development] and [devops].

And, I am still moving forward.


## time passes, life goes on

Now that I am past my fortieth year as a programmer - a career that has spanned more than eighty percent of my life,
what I really enjoy most is guiding and coaching the next generation of programmers and software architects - awakening
others to the same joy and passion for computing that I have had for more than forty years.
