Today, we started the [Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation] on-line tutorial from [Kahn Academy].

We completed four lessons:

- [Intro to Programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/intro-to-programming/v/programming-intro)
- [Drawing basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/drawing-basics/p/making-drawings-with-code)
- [Coloring](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/coloring/p/coloring-with-code)
- [Variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/variables/p/intro-to-variables)

We also started working on our [SpaceHockey] game.
