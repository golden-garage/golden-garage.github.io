# about this garage

I'm consolidating the various projects that I have been working on into one place: this garage.

This garage is a lot like other garages. Instead of a car being in this garage, there are boxes full of miscelleanous
stuff stacked in the corners, projects half-finished (half-started) spread across a couple of old tables, and there
against one wall under a tarp, is some music gear - amps, mic stands, keyboards, guitars - they just need to be plugged
in, and the music will flow.

It's a been a while since I've really hung out in the garage. But, that's about to change.

Some of the boxes stacked in the corners haven't been opened in years. Some boxes are overstuffed and you can see
things poking out - trying to escape. Other, neglected boxes, are starting to fall apart. Some boxes are a mystery -
I'm not sure if they belong in this garage at all.

The projects still taking up space on the tables in the garage need to be worked on and finished, or they need to be
moved off of the tables to make room for something new. A few of the projects are clearly broken or missing parts. One
or two projects look close to completion. I wonder if the pile of parts on the small table is a project in process or
something I've forgotten to put away?

These melodies and chords in my head need to be expressed - some *gently, soulfully* - others with the volume knob
turned up to *e l e v e n !* The guitars need to be tuned. My fingers are soft - missing their calluses. The mics need
to be plugged in. My voice is older - but, still wants to sing. I wonder what else is under that tarp?

It's time to clean-up, reorganize and play.

# about Rick Golden, the programmer

In the summer of 1972, Rick sat in the computer lab at [SUNY Fredonia] and completed his first [CAI tutorial] for
programming in the computer programming language [APL]. He was nine years old.

Today, Rick teaches nine year olds how to program during week long summer camps and after school worshops. However,
back in 1972 when Rick was nine - back when computers were programmed with [punched cards], data was stored on
[9-track tape] and [program] output was delivered the next day (at the earliest) on green and white barred
[print-out paper] - back when a single computer weighed thousands of pounds, required multiple cabinets, an entire air
conditioned room of its own with a team of human operators to keep its [jobs] running - back when [COBOL] was king of
the [mainframes] and [Pascal] was the pawn of [microcomputers] - back in 1972, there weren't very many 9 year olds
programming computers.

Most of the programming that Rick has done since then, has been in [structured programming] languages like [PL/I],
[FORTRAN], [BASIC], [Pascal], [UCSD Pascal], [C], [C++], [C#], [Objective C] and [Java]. He did occasionally write code
in languages like [APL], [FORTH], [LISP], and [Scheme]; however, he could not find an employer that would actually
invest beyond prototypoing solutions using those non-structured languages. Rick has had success in recent years
introducing organizations to scripting languages like [Python], [Perl], [TCL], [Ruby], [Groovy] and [Javascript].

Rick has also had the privilege to work in many different domains applying leading technologies through each cutting
edge wave of programming techniques, architectural frameworks and design patterns. Rick has championed
[distributed computing], [scripting languages], [SOA], [web applications], [CMS], [ESBs], [web services], [nosql],
[map-reduce], [containerization], [micro-services] and [cluster computing]; [top down structured approach], [UML],
[use cases], [XP - extreme programming], [iterative development], and [agile development]. And, he is still moving
forward.

Now, as he passes his fortieth year as a programmer - a career that has spanned more than eighty percent of his life,
Rick enjoys guiding and coaching the next generation of programmers and software architects - awakening others to the
same joy and passion for computing that he has had for more than forty years.

# about Rick Golden, the musician

While sitting in a cave near the [Manzanita Mine], over looking Sulfur Creek near [Wilbur Hot Springs], I wrote my
first song, "Sun Wind Moon Rain". I was twenty-five. My oldest child at the time was seven and my youngest five. The
song reflected upon loss and the pain of divorce.

For the next five years, as I drifted through many unplanned adventures and strange trips a guitar was my constant
companion. I didn't learn to play it well. But it did support me as I sang my way soulfully through those turbulent
times. I didn't learn to sing, either. But, I did find a way through my voice to let go and heal.

As I turned thirty, I remarried. I put away my guitar and focused on learning to live in another country, speak another
language and raise another three kids. I lost touch with my first two kids by not being responsible enough. I wasn't
going to lose these three kids through the same self-absorbed complacency. No matter how much effort it took. No matter
how much traveling it took. No matter how much time it took. I was going to see it through.

After about a dozen years or so of traveling during the week for work - being only home on the weekend - traveling
started getting old and instead of enjoying the scenic European countryside, I spent most of my time feeling
lonely. But, bills got paid. Food filled the fridge (most of the time). For my three German kids there was always food
on the table and a comfortable place to live. But, by traveling all the time I ended up very lonely.

Traveling for work paid the bills but it was not good for relationships of any kind. My marriage suffered. I was not
the father I could have been. Still, I needed to travel to find work. And, with all that travel, I had become
complacent once, again. Fulfilling my responsibilities as provider somehow justified my self-absorbed loneliness.

My resignation to travel for work, created the opportunity for me to travel to [Erlangen, Germany] and to work for
[Spirit Link, GmbH]. Through that job, I did manage to find a spirit link to a new best friend, [Ingo].

Ingo lost his wife to cancer just before I arrived in Erlangen. He also lost his two step-daughters. They moved in
with their natural father after their mom died. Ingo was all alone. In a very big house.

In the basement of his house, Ingo had a guest bedroom - that he had converted into a music studio. He and his wife had
[enjoyed creating music together]. But, he had stopped making music when she died. So, he had an extra bedroom and I
was welcome to stay there whenever I worked in Erlangen.

I lived in that music studio five days a week for a very long, peaceful time. I had finally managed to shake the
loneliness I had felt since first moving to Germany. During the day, Ingo and I worked together. We were teammates at
Spirit Link. In the evening, we'd make music until we could no longer keep our eyes open. Ingo played keyboards and
drums. I played guitar and sang. He mixed all our creativity together producing amazing songs. [Indigo Blues].

It's been more than ten years since I was in Erlangen. I moved away as Ingo fell in love with Fiddi, and I managed to
find a job that required a lot less travel. I could finalyy work on rebuild my relationships at home. Music was set
aside again. I did play the guitar occasionally and sing, but I had stopped making music.
