# about this garage

I'm consolidating the various projects that I have been working on into one place: this garage.

This garage is a lot like other garages. Instead of a car being in this garage, there are boxes full of miscelleanous
stuff stacked in the corners, projects half-finished (half-started) spread across a couple of old tables, and there
against one wall under a tarp, is some music gear - amps, mic stands, keyboards, guitars - they just need to be plugged
in, and the music will flow.

It's a been a while since I've really hung out in the garage. But, that's about to change.

Some of the boxes stacked in the corners haven't been opened in years. Some boxes are overstuffed and you can see
things poking out - trying to escape. Other, neglected boxes, are starting to fall apart. Some boxes are a mystery -
I'm not sure if they belong in this garage at all.

The projects still taking up space on the tables in the garage need to be worked on and finished, or they need to be
moved off of the tables to make room for something new. A few of the projects are clearly broken or missing parts. One
or two projects look close to completion. I wonder if the pile of parts on the small table is a project in process or
something I've forgotten to put away?

These melodies and chords in my head need to be expressed - some *gently, soulfully* - others with the volume knob
turned up to *e l e v e n !* The guitars need to be tuned. My fingers are soft - missing their calluses. The mics need
to be plugged in. My voice is older - but, still wants to sing. I wonder what else is under that tarp?

It's time to clean-up, reorganize and play.

# about Rick Golden, the programmer

In the summer of 1972, Rick sat in the computer lab at [SUNY Fredonia] and completed his first [CAI tutorial] for
programming in [APL]. He was nine years old.

Today, Rick teaches nine year olds how to program during week long summer camps and after school worshops. However,
back in 1972 when Rick was nine - back when computers were programmed with [punched cards], data was stored on
[9-track tape] and [program] output was delivered the next day (at the earliest) on green and white barred
[print-out paper] - back when a single computer weighed thousands of pounds, required multiple cabinets, an entire air
conditioned room of its own with a team of human operators to keep its [jobs] running - back when [COBOL] was king of
the [mainframes] and [Pascal] was the pawn of [microcomputers] - back in 1972, there weren't very many 9 year olds
programming computers.

Most of the programming that Rick has done since then, has been in [structured programming] languages like [PL/I],
[FORTRAN], [BASIC], [Pascal], [C], [C++], [C#], [Objective C] and [Java]. He did occasionally write code in languages
like [APL], [FORTH], [LISP], and [Scheme]; however, he could not find an employer that would actually invest beyond
prototypoing solutions using those non-structured languages. Rick has had success in recent years introducing
organizations to scripting languages like [Python], [Perl], [TCL], [Ruby], [Groovy] and [Javascript].

Rick has also had the privilege to work in many different domains applying leading technologies through each cutting
edge wave of programming techniques, architectural frameworks and design patterns. Rick has championed
[distributed computing], [scripting languages], [SOA], [web applications], [CMS], [ESBs], [web services], [nosql],
[map-reduce], [containerization], [micro-services] and [cluster computing]; [top down structured approach], [UML],
[use cases], [XP - extreme programming], [iterative development], and [agile development]. And, he is still moving
forward.

Now, as he passes his fortieth year as a programmer - a career that has spanned more than eighty percent of his life,
Rick enjoys guiding and coaching the next generation of programmers and software architects - awakening others to the
same joy and passion for computing that he has had for more than forty years.

# about Rick Golden, the musician

While sitting in a cave near the [Manzanita Mine], over looking Sulfur Creek near [Wilbur Hot Springs], I wrote my
first song, "Sun Wind Moon Rain". I was twenty-three. My oldest child at the time was seven and my youngest five. The
song is about losing touch and the pain of divorce.

When I was thirty, I put away my guitar and focused on learning to live in another country, Germany, and speak
another language, German (Schwaebisch) while raising another three kids.
