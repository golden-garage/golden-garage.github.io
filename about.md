### about me

In the summer of 1972, I sat in the computer lab at SUNY Fredonia and completed my first CAI tutorial for programming
in APL. I was nine years old.

Most of the programming that I have done since then, has been in Algol-based languages like PL/I, FORTRAN, BASIC,
Pascal, C, C++, C#, Objective C and Java. I did occasionally write code in languages like APL, FORTH, LISP, and Scheme;
however, I could not find an employer that would actually pay me to develop solutions using those non-structured
languages. Although, I have had success in recent years introducing organizations to scripting languages like Python,
Perl, TCL, Ruby, Groovy and node.js.

I have also had the privilege to work in many different domains applying leading technologies through each cutting edge
wave of structured programming, architectural frameworks and design patterns. I have championed distributed computing,
scripting languages, SOA, browser applications, CMS, ESBs, web services, nosql and map-reduce; top down structured
approach, UML, use cases, XP - extreme programming, iterative development, and agile development. And, I am still
moving forward.

Now, as I approach my fortieth year as a programmer, software architect and product manager - a career that has spanned
eighty percent of my life, I enjoy guiding and coaching the next generation of programmers and software architects -
awakening others to the same joy and passion for computing that I have had for the past forty years.
