# about the programmer

In the summer of 1972, I sat in the computer lab at [SUNY Fredonia] and completed my first [CAI tutorial] for
programming in the computer programming language [APL]. I was nine years old.

Today, I teach nine year olds how to program during week long summer camps and after school worshops. However,
back in 1972 when I was nine - back when computers were programmed with [punched cards], data was stored on
[9-track tape] and [program] output was delivered the next day (at the earliest) on green and white barred
[print-out paper] - back when a single computer weighed thousands of pounds, required multiple cabinets, an entire air
conditioned room of its own with a team of human operators to keep its [jobs] running - back when [COBOL] was king of
the [mainframes] and [Pascal] was the pawn of [microcomputers] - back in 1972, there weren't very many 9 year olds
programming computers.

Most of the programming that I have done since then, has been in [structured programming] languages like [PL/I],
[FORTRAN], [BASIC], [Pascal], [UCSD Pascal], [C], [C++], [C#], [Objective C] and [Java]. I did occasionally write code
in languages like [APL], [FORTH], [LISP], and [Scheme]; however, I could not find an employer that would actually
invest beyond prototypoing solutions using these non-structured languages. I have however had some success in recent
years introducing organizations to scripting languages like [Python] and [Javascript].

I have also had the privilege of working in many different domains applying leading technologies through each cutting
edge wave of programming techniques, architectural frameworks and design patterns. I have championed
[distributed computing], [scripting languages], [SOA], [web applications], [CMS], [ESBs], [web services], [nosql],
[map-reduce], [containerization], [micro-services] and [cluster computing]; [top down structured approach], [UML],
[use cases], [XP - extreme programming], [iterative development], and [agile development]. And, I am still moving
forward.

Now that I am past my fortieth year as a programmer - a career that has spanned more than eighty percent of my life, I
really enjoy most guiding and coaching the next generation of programmers and software architects - awakening others to
the same joy and passion for computing that I have had for more than forty years.
