## traveling for work

As I turned thirty, I remarried and moved to Germany. 

I put away my guitar and focused on learning to live in another country, speak another language and raise another set
of kids.

I lost touch with my first two kids by not being responsible enough as afather and provider. I wasn't going to lose
these three kids through the same self-absorbed complacency. No matter how much effort it took.

No matter how much traveling it took.

No matter how much time it took. I was going to see it through.

## complacent, once gain

After about a dozen years or so of traveling during the week for work - being only home on the weekend - traveling
started getting old and instead of enjoying the scenic European countryside as I traveled, I spent most of my time
feeling lonely.

Food filled the fridge and bills got paid. For my three German kids there was always food on the table and a
comfortable place to live.

Yet, by traveling to support the family, I ended up being very lonely.

Traveling for work paid the bills but it was not good for relationships of any kind. My marriage suffered. I was not
the father I could have been. 

Still, I needed to travel to find work. And, with all that travel, I had become complacent, once again. 

Fulfilling my responsibilities as provider somehow justified my self-absorbed loneliness.

I had finally managed to shake the
loneliness I had felt since first moving to Germany.
